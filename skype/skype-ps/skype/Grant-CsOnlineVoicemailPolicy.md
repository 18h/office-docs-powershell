You can return your tenant ID by running this command:

Get-CsTenant | Select-Object DisplayName, TenantID

If you are using a remote session of Windows PowerShell and are connected only to Skype for Business Online you do not have to include the Tenant parameter. Instead, the tenant ID will automatically be filled in for you based on your connection information. The Tenant parameter is primarily for use in a hybrid deployment.

### -AsJob
Indicates that this cmdlet runs as a background job.

When you specify the AsJob parameter, the command immediately returns an object that represents the background job. You can continue to work in the session while the job finishes. The job is created on the local computer and the results from the Skype for Business Online session are automatically returned to the local computer. To get the job results, use the Receive-Job cmdlet.
